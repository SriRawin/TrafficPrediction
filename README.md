# Traffic Prediction

A Flutter application built with Flutter and Google maps API

Through this project, I learned how to use Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and got familiar in developing apps based on google maps.

## How the app works

- Basic idea was to fetch current location of the user
- Search for destination based on user query
- Based on the start and end point, the app would suggest the user at what time the user can travel to have optimal travel time taking traffic into consideration
